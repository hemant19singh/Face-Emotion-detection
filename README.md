Install jupyter environment to run these files.

Files desciption:
1. emotion-classification-cnn-using-keras.ipynb : Model training and validation jupyter file.
2. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml : Classifying frontal faces with the help of Haar Cascade Classifier.
3. main.ipynb : capturing live camera feed and predicting the face emotion using the saved model and frontalface xml file.
4. model.h5 : Trained and saved model for prediction so that we don't have to train and load the model everytime.

All the best!
